This is the project I did in Insight. It is a consulting project with WeSpire. Their action-based employee engagement platform helps employees build awareness, take actions and inspire them to participate in a wide variety of programs, including: volunteering, wellbeing, sustainability, society and etc. The goal of this project is to identify the types of actions that active users are engaged.
